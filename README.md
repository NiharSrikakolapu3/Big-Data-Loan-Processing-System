Big Data Loan Processing System

This project implements a gRPC server that interacts with HDFS and MySQL, processes loan data for Wisconsin counties, and provides RPC methods to query and manipulate the data. All services run in Docker containers for easy setup and testing.

Repository

Clone the repository:

git clone git@github.com:NiharSrikakolapu3/Big-Data-Loan-Processing-System.git
cd Big-Data-Loan-Processing-System

Prerequisites

Docker (v20+)

Docker Compose (v2+)

Python 3.12 (optional if running client inside container)

Bash shell

Setup

Set the project environment variable

export PROJECT=p4


This is required by the Docker Compose file to name all images and services.

Build Docker Images

Build all required images for the project:

sudo docker-compose build


This builds the following images:

p4-hdfs

p4-nn

p4-dn

p4-mysql

p4-server

Start Docker Compose Cluster
sudo docker-compose up -d


This starts:

3 DataNodes (p4-dn-1, p4-dn-2, p4-dn-3)

1 NameNode (p4-nn-1)

MySQL (p4-mysql-1)

gRPC Server (p4-server-1)

Check logs for server output:

sudo docker logs -f p4-server-1

Run Client Commands (Inside Server Container)

Enter the server container:

sudo docker exec -it p4-server-1 bash

Part 1: Upload to HDFS (DbToHdfs)
python3 client.py DbToHdfs


Joins loans and loan_types tables in MySQL.

Filters loans by loan_amount between 30,000 and 800,000.

Writes /hdma-wi-2021.parquet to HDFS with 2x replication and 1-MB block size.

Verify upload:

hdfs dfs -du -h /hdma-wi-2021.parquet


Expected file size: ~28â€“30 MB

Part 2: Check Block Locations
python3 client.py BlockLocations -f /hdma-wi-2021.parquet


Returns a dictionary showing block distribution across DataNodes, e.g.:

{'7eb74ce67e75': 15, 'f7747b42d254': 7, '39750756065d': 8}

Part 3: Calculate Average Loan for a County
python3 client.py CalcAvgLoan -c <county_code>


Example:

python3 client.py CalcAvgLoan -c 55001


Filters /hdma-wi-2021.parquet by county_code.

Computes average loan amount.

Writes partitions/<county_code>.parquet for reuse.

Returns avg_loan and source (create, reuse, recreate).

Part 4: Fault Tolerance Test

Kill a DataNode:

sudo docker kill p4-dn-1


Re-run CalcAvgLoan for a county with 1x replication:

python3 client.py CalcAvgLoan -c 55001


If the county-specific file was lost, source will show recreate.
